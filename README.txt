==Prioritizer

Small set of programs for helping me organize my thoughts. Therapeutic to make
and use.

Right now prioritizer.py's goal in life is to "pit" tasks against one another
in a command-line battle for a higher priority. Highest priority item wins 
after about log_2(n) rounds. 

get_tasks.py's goal in life is to create a sqlite database in your home folder
with your tasks. 

Designed to work with python3.

prioritizer.py does not currently get tasks from database. Sorry.
